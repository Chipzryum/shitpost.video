1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,786
I'll try to make this short,

2
00:00:01,786 --> 00:00:03,573
but don't judge just off the

3
00:00:03,573 --> 00:00:05,360
title. I(29f) went out for

4
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,146
dinner with husband (28m) last

5
00:00:07,146 --> 00:00:08,933
night - nothing fancy just a

6
00:00:08,933 --> 00:00:10,720
chain sports bar - and it

7
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,507
being a Friday, the place was

8
00:00:12,507 --> 00:00:14,293
packed. We sit, place our

9
00:00:14,293 --> 00:00:16,080
order, and we're catching up

10
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,867
on the day everything is going

11
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:19,654
fine. When the waitress

12
00:00:19,654 --> 00:00:21,440
brought out our appetizer, my

13
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,227
husband grabs about 4 decent

14
00:00:23,227 --> 00:00:25,014
sized tortilla chips and

15
00:00:25,014 --> 00:00:26,801
scoops an actual mountain of

16
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:28,587
spinach dip with them and

17
00:00:28,587 --> 00:00:30,374
shoved the whole thing in his

18
00:00:30,374 --> 00:00:32,161
mouth. And when I say shoved I

19
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:33,947
mean SHOVED his fingers in his

20
00:00:33,947 --> 00:00:35,734
mouth with the food. By the

21
00:00:35,734 --> 00:00:37,521
time I'd had 3 chips with some

22
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:39,308
dip the entire rest of the

23
00:00:39,308 --> 00:00:41,094
appetizer was gone so I was

24
00:00:41,094 --> 00:00:42,881
already irked and embarrassed

25
00:00:42,881 --> 00:00:44,668
because of course people were

26
00:00:44,668 --> 00:00:46,455
staring at us. I said as much

27
00:00:46,455 --> 00:00:48,241
to him and when he said he

28
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:50,028
didn't see what he was doing

29
00:00:50,028 --> 00:00:51,815
wrong, I told him "you're

30
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:53,602
acting like you've never seen

31
00:00:53,602 --> 00:00:55,388
food before, it's

32
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,175
embarrassing." He didn't say

33
00:00:57,175 --> 00:00:58,962
another word to me after that,

34
00:00:58,962 --> 00:01:00,749
and has barely spoke to me

35
00:01:00,749 --> 00:01:02,535
today either. I don't think

36
00:01:02,535 --> 00:01:04,322
I'm the asshole for telling

37
00:01:04,322 --> 00:01:06,109
him I was embarrassed by how

38
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:07,895
he was eating and annoyed that

39
00:01:07,895 --> 00:01:09,682
most of the appetizer was

40
00:01:09,682 --> 00:01:11,469
eaten by him, but I may have

41
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:13,256
taken it too far with the last

42
00:01:13,256 --> 00:01:15,042
comment. For further context

43
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:16,829
no, this isn't the first time

44
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:18,616
this has happened. I've told

45
00:01:18,616 --> 00:01:20,403
him multiple times it's

46
00:01:20,403 --> 00:01:22,189
embarrassing when he does this

47
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:23,976
and asked him why so I can try

48
00:01:23,976 --> 00:01:25,763
to help or at least understand

49
00:01:25,763 --> 00:01:27,550
a bit better. It's only at

50
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,336
this specific chain and his

51
00:01:29,336 --> 00:01:31,123
answer always is either idk or

52
00:01:31,123 --> 00:01:32,910
that he "really loves the

53
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,697
spinach dip" they have. He

54
00:01:34,697 --> 00:01:36,483
also does this at home but I

55
00:01:36,483 --> 00:01:38,270
don't really care when he's at

56
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,057
home because I'm not going to

57
00:01:40,057 --> 00:01:41,843
dictate how he acts in the

58
00:01:41,843 --> 00:01:43,630
privacy of our house. Also to

59
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,417
note because I'm sure people

60
00:01:45,417 --> 00:01:47,204
may ask, no he did not grow up

61
00:01:47,204 --> 00:01:48,990
in a food insecure household,

62
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,777
they weren't rich but not

63
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,564
struggling that much. And

64
00:01:52,564 --> 00:01:54,351
neither are we struggling now.

65
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:56,137
No there is no history with an

66
00:01:56,137 --> 00:01:57,924
eating disorder either in him

67
00:01:57,924 --> 00:01:59,711
or his family. Am I the

68
00:01:59,711 --> 00:02:01,498
asshole?
